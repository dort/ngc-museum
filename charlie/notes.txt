I've been trying to figure out how to load cifar data into the pc_discrim exhibit here for the past hour or so, and with chatgpt's help I at least got the train_pcn.py file to now load the npy files that came from the cifar dataset without an error about reading the wrong type of file when fetching from disk.

I'm working with cifar-10 (python version) so downloaded from this link: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-python.tar.gz

and then converted with the cifar_converter.py script (make a folder inside the resulting cifar-10-batches-py/ folder after
tar xzvf cifar-10-python.tar.gz
gets run and then inside that folder put the cifar_converter.py script and make another completed/ directory inside there to generate the npy files that will get successfully loaded)

that's all progress but it's not actually succeeding when running (which is not surprising as chatgpt didn't understand exactly what's needed (nor do i yet) with respect to how the files are "constructed" to set up the training so that it'll work)

more to come...
